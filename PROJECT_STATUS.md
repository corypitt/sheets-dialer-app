# Project Status Tracker: Google Sheets Dialer App

This file serves as the central source of truth for project progress, remaining tasks, and implementation status for our modular microservice-based application.

> **Note about file tracking**: This status document may not have context on all files in the repository. When adding new files or making significant changes, please update this document accordingly.

## Project Overview

We're building a microservice-based application that:
1. Syncs data from Google Sheets to Supabase
2. Provides user authentication via Google/Supabase
3. Displays a paginated list of leads with a "dialer-like" detail view
4. Is deployed on Vercel

## Implementation Progress Summary

- **Core Files**: ✅ All core microservice files created
- **Authentication**: ✅ Implementation complete, needs testing
- **Google Sheets Integration**: ✅ Implementation complete, needs testing
- **UI Components**: ✅ Implementation complete, needs testing
- **API Routes**: ✅ All routes implemented
- **Supporting Files**: ✅ README added, Setup guide created
- **External Setup**: ❌ Supabase & Google setup needed
- **Deployment**: ❌ Not started

## Validation Checkpoints

To verify the application is functioning correctly, we'll use these key validation points:

1. **Authentication Flow** ✅ Implementation complete, needs testing
   - Sign in with Google via Supabase
   - Successful redirect to the dashboard
   - Session persistence and logout functionality

2. **Google Sheets Integration** ✅ Implementation complete, needs testing
   - Successful connection to Google Sheets API
   - Proper data syncing to Supabase database
   - Handling of new, updated, and deleted rows

3. **UI Functionality** ✅ Implementation complete, needs testing
   - Dashboard loads and displays leads from Supabase
   - Pagination works correctly
   - Lead detail "dialer" view functions properly

4. **External Service Integration** 🔄 In progress
   - Minimal Supabase project setup (authentication + database)
   - Google Cloud project with Sheets API enabled
   - Environment variables configured properly

5. **Deployment** ❌ Not started
   - Successful deployment to Vercel
   - Cron job functioning for regular syncs
   - Production environment variables configured

> **Testing Strategy**: We will use real external services (minimal setup) rather than mocks for validation.

## Next Focused Task

> **Note**: Tasks are intentionally modular to work within AI context limitations.
> Only focus on one task at a time to ensure completion.

### Current Priority: External Services Setup

```
Use the SETUP.md guide to configure minimal external services:
1. Create a Supabase project with Google auth provider enabled
2. Set up a Google Cloud project with Sheets API
3. Create the necessary environment variables file
4. Test authentication flow and sheets sync functionality
```

## Environment Setup Status

- [x] Create `package.json` with required dependencies
- [x] Create Supabase auth service
- [x] Create Google Sheets sync service
- [x] Create Next.js application framework
- [x] Create Vercel configuration file
- [x] Create environment variables example file
- [x] Create project README
- [x] Create Supabase tables SQL
- [x] Create setup guide
- [ ] Configure test external services

## Implementation Status (Detailed)

### Supabase Configuration

- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Set up Google OAuth provider in Supabase
- [ ] Create `profiles` table
- [ ] Create `leads` table with required schema
  
### Google Setup

- [ ] Create Google Cloud project
- [ ] Enable Google Sheets API
- [ ] Create Service Account
- [ ] Generate and download JSON key
- [ ] Share test Google Sheet with Service Account
- [ ] Prepare test Sheet with appropriate columns

### Next.js Implementation

- [x] Create main application file
- [x] Implement authentication flow
- [x] Implement leads listing with pagination
- [x] Implement lead detail "dialer" view
- [x] Set up API routes:
  - [x] Created `/api/sync-sheets.js`
  - [x] Created `/api/auth/callback.js`

## Ready-to-Use Task Modules

When ready for the next step, select ONE of these modular tasks:

### Module 1: Set up Minimal External Services
```
Follow the SETUP.md guide to set up minimal external services for testing
```

### Module 2: Implement Testing Patch
```
Add code modifications for testing without external services (mock data approach)
```

### Module 3: Set Up Vercel Deployment
```
Create deployment configuration for Vercel including environment variables
```

### Module 4: Document Testing Results
```
Create TESTING.md with test results and validation of each checkpoint
```

## Troubleshooting Reference

### Authentication Troubleshooting
- Ensure Google OAuth is properly configured in Supabase dashboard
- Verify redirect URIs match exactly
- Check for correct environment variables

### Sync Troubleshooting
- Validate Google Service Account has Sheet access
- Check private key formatting (newlines as \n)
- Verify Sheet column headers match expected fields

### Development Tips
- Test auth flow locally with http://localhost:3000/auth/callback in allowed redirects
- For Google Sheets API: Start with a small sheet (10-20 rows) for testing
- Test incremental sync by modifying a few rows and running sync again
